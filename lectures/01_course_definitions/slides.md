## Definitions

![confuse](../images/confusion.png)

#### Some words

* Provisioning (by the book - Morris)
  * "making an infrastructure element"
    * Getting network device/servers ready to use (installed, configured and registered)
* Orchestration
  * Arranging or coordinating multiple systems
  * Provisioning many servers at once
    * Running same task on many servers at once
    * Automate tasks and orchestrate processes
* Configuration Management
  * Practices for handling provisioning and orchestration
    * Configure your server or infrastructure repeatedly, consistently, transparent...
* Infrastructure as Code
  * Applying (agile) software engineering techniques on operations
* Deployment Infrastructures
  * Cloud-based Dynamic Infrastructure platforms for deploying software

## Dynamic Infrastructure platform

* public/private IaaS, community IaaS...AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, OpenStack
  * Tools for configuration management and provisioning
  * Must be programmable, on-demand, self-service
    * Having programmable interfaces
    * Create and destroy immediately
    * Be able to customize your given resources
* May create servers but is not responsible on what is on them (but could be)
* May pass configuration info to a server configuration tool (network addresses)
* This is a requirement for Infrastructure As Code
(Morris - chapter 2, Should be recap)


--
## Tools requirements

  - Programmable
    - GUI is nice but we want APIs or declarative languages
  - Scriptable & Powerful command-line tools
    * CLI program
    * Take input from other tools (stdin, environment variables, command-line parameters)
    * Output should be able to be used by other tools
  - Support for unattended execution
    * No manual steps in the scripts
    * Triggable scripts, notifications
      * Testable, auto-scaling and recovery routines
  - Externalized configurations
    * Treated as software source code
    * Transparently, consistently, accurate test instances, version control



<!-- Configuration management -->
## Configuration management
"Configuration management (CM) is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life."

* Manage changes throughout the system lifecycle of complex systems
* ITIL, formally an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure Library
  *  ITIL volumes as guidance to their IT organizations


--
## Configuration management

* Mange all of the changes that happen whitin your project.
* Records the evolution of your systems and applications
* Handle and govern how your team collaborates


--

So it is about using version control systems?

## Configuration management and DevOps

* Be able to reproduce any of the environments (operating system, patch level, network configs, software stack and so on)
  * Automation tools, infrastructure as code
* Be able to handle changes (and roll-backs) to the items and deploy to all of my environments
  * Version control
  * Develop vs. testing vs. staging vs. production
* Be able to trace all of your changes
* Manage dependencies, components, software configuration
* Can every team member get the information they need?


--
## Configuration management - Our focus

* Infrastructure as code (IoC)
  * Infrastructure automation based on practices for software development
    * Your infrastructure is treated the same way as your code
    * "Code should be written to describe the desired state of the new machine"
  * Virtualization, cloud, containers, server automation...
  * Defining your environments as code
    * code as documentation, no manual differences (snowflake servers)
* Tools for automation of infrastructure
  * Chef, Ansible, Puppet...


---
## Challenges for IoC

  * Server sprawl
    * It is easy to create new servers, hard to manage to mandatory
  * Configuration Drift
    * Difference can creep in over time
      * Manual "fixing" a specific problem on one servers
      * Updating the application platform on just some servers (not all applications)
      * The configuration settings for same kind of servers differs from different people
      * Someone optimize a specific application server to quickfix a performance issue
  * Snowflake servers
    * A server that canÂ´t be replicated === Fragile infrastructure
  * Automation fear - Kill and rebuild
  * Erosion
    * Things will happen over time (security updates, disk space, restart processes, hardware error)


--
## Principle of IoC
* It should be easy to destroy and rebuild systems/servers
  * The design should support a infrastructure that is always changing
  * "Treat your servers as cattle, not pets"
* System should be consistent
  * Same type of servers should have identical configurations - server templates
* If a task can be scripted, script it!
  * Definition files, consistency, documentation
* Testability
  * Bringing automated testing into Ops


---
## Reading to do

* Read (at least) chapter 1 in Morris book
  * ![book](../images/book.gif) http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039297.do
* Infrastructure as code - the engine of DevOps
  * https://www.epam.com/about/news-and-events/in-the-news/2015/infrastructure-as-code-the-engine-at-the-heart-of-devops
* 2017 State of DevOps Report
