## Patterns for provisioning servers
### Characteristics of an effective provisioning process
* Infrastructure elements can be rebuilt on demand
* Define elements once -> roll out to multiple
* Transparent and easily modified

Note:
* Any **existing infrastructure element** can be effortlessly **rebuilt on demand**.<br/>
* A **new element can be defined once**, and then rolled out and replicated to multiple instances and environments.<br/>
* The **definition of any element**, and the process to provision it, is **transparent and easily modified**.
