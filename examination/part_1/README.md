## Part 1 - Evaluation of configuration management tools

In this assignment you are going to learn about modern configuration management tools and present your findings in a written rapport. The goal with this assignment is that you will get deeper understanding of what different modern tools there are for automating the configuration management for infrastructure. You will also compere these tools and try to to describe there differences. At the latest step you should create your own opinion about these tools.

You will investigate at least three different tools. Here are our suggestions (but you can choose other if you want)
  * [Puppet](https://puppet.com/)
  * [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
  * [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)

### Disposition
You will be examined trough a written report. Your are pretty free to structure the report but it should (at least) focus on the following parts.

* Describe the tools and their history
* Describe there different payment models, licenses and so on
* Describe how the tools differs
* Describe the prerequisites for the tool what platforms they work on
* Give some simple example of syntax
* List pros and cons
* Try to motivate your favorite (as far as you can tell). In the end of the course you will have a project where you will try out one of these technologies. Which one will you choose and why?

Try to have an idea how you structure your report so it will be easy to read and to find in. As usually you should use the IEEE-reference system when handling your sources.

We have not set a minimum requirements for this assigment so we expect that you are experience enough to hold it within a reasonable number of pages.

## Part 2 - Nearby questions
* Describe how you think the DevOps movement changes and will change the software development area.
* Explain (in a paragraph or two) what the following tools do and the difference between them:
    * Kubernetes
    * Docker Swarm
    * Docker Compose
